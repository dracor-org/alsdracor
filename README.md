# AlsDraCor
The **Als**atian **Dra**ma **Cor**pus is an endeavour by
[Laboratoire LiLPa](https://lilpa.unistra.fr/) at University of Strasbourg. We
will slowly start building a corpus of TEI-encoded plays in Alsatian dialect.

To start off, we encoded a decisive play in Alsatian theatre history, Johann
Georg Daniel Arnold's "Der Pfingstmontag" ("Le Lundi de Pentec√¥te"), published
in 1816.
