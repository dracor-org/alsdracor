# AlsDraCor
The **Als**atian **Dra**ma **Cor**pus is a growing corpus of TEI-encoded plays
in [Alsatian dialect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alsatian_dialect).
It is based on the corpus being built by the MeThAL project
([Towards a Macroanalysis of Theater in Alsatian](https://methal.pages.unistra.fr/en.html)),
hosted at [Laboratoire LiLPa](https://lilpa.unistra.fr/) (University of Strasbourg).

The corpus can be explored on the corresponding DraCor page: https://dracor.org/als
