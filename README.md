# AlsDraCor
The **Als**atian **Dra**ma **Cor**pus is an endeavour of
[Laboratoire LiLPa](https://lilpa.unistra.fr/) at University of Strasbourg.
We slowly start building a corpus of TEI-encoded plays in Alsatian dialect.

To start off, we encoded a decisive play in Alsatian theatre history, Johann
Georg Daniel Arnold's "Der Pfingstmontag" ("Le Lundi de Pentec√¥te"), published
in 1816, and Gustave Stoskopf's "In's Ropfer's Apothek" ("At Ropfer's Pharmacy"),
published in 1907.
